## Overview

**Overdose Stealer** is a tool developed to demonstrate the process of extracting and decrypting Discord authentication tokens stored locally on a Windows system. This tool uses DPAPI and AES-GCM decryption techniques to recover the tokens from Discord‚Äôs installation files. The extracted tokens, along with system information like the username and IP address, are sent to a specified Discord webhook in a structured format.

This public version is intended for educational purposes, showcasing the core functionality of the tool. A more advanced and feature-rich private version is under development.

## Key Features

üîë **Token Extraction**  
   - Extracts Discord authentication tokens from `%AppData%\Roaming\discord`.

üîê **Dual Token Support**  
   - Handles both AES-GCM encrypted tokens and plain text MFA tokens.

üîì **Decryption Techniques**  
   - Uses DPAPI to decrypt the master key stored in the `Local State` file.
   - Utilizes AES-GCM decryption via the BouncyCastle library to extract tokens.

üñ•Ô∏è **System Info Collection**  
   - Collects basic system information such as the username and public IP address.

üì§ **Webhook Reporting**  
   - Sends the extracted data as a structured Discord embed to a specified webhook URL.
