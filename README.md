## Overview

**Overdose Stealer** is a tool developed to demonstrate the process of extracting and decrypting Discord authentication tokens stored locally on a Windows system. This tool uses DPAPI and AES-GCM decryption techniques to recover the tokens from Discord’s installation files. The extracted tokens, along with system information like the username and IP address, are sent to a specified Discord webhook in a structured format.

This public version is intended for educational purposes, showcasing the core functionality of the tool. A more advanced and feature-rich private version is under development.

> 🔄 **Update (2024-04-30)**:  
> A new module has been added to detect and extract local wallet data from several popular cryptocurrency wallets, expanding the forensic capabilities of the tool.
